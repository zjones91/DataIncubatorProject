Cinema in the United States was reported as grossing over $11 billion in 2017. However the narrative of movies focusing on female leads being less profitable still permeates the industry. In this project, I would like to do a comprehensive analysis of the entertainment industry, analyzing numerous variables including, though not limited to, budget, box office gross, rating of movie, and whether the movie was able to pass the Bechdel Test. I believe this information could provide statistics as to whether or not movies have been slanted against women over time, as well as whether or not such movies actually can be expected to perform better given past trends.
